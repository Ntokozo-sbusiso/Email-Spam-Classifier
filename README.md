### NLP Email Spam Classifier
Project Description

This project is an NLP-based email spam classifier that allows users to detect spam emails using three different machine learning models:

    NaÃ¯ve Bayes (Highest Accuracy)
    Logistic Regression
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The project features a user-friendly interface, where users can paste or type an email and select the model of their choice to classify the message as Spam or Not Spam.
Features

- Choose between three machine learning models for classification.
- Paste or write an email directly in the interface.
- Instant prediction results.
- Simple and interactive user experience.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

    Python3
    Required libraries (install using the command below)

# Installation Steps

    Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:Ntokozo-sbusiso/Email-Spam-Classifier.git



## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the application:

    python3 app.py

    Open the interface in your browser (if using Flask/Streamlit, it will provide a local URL).

### Usage

    Open the application.
    Paste or type an email message.
    Select a model for classification.
    View the classification result (Spam / Not Spam).

### Models Used

    1 NaÃ¯ve Bayes (Best Accuracy)
    2 Logistic Regression
    3 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

These models were trained on a labeled dataset of emails to detect spam effectively.
### Technologies Used

    Python
    Scikit-learn (for ML models)
    NLTK / SpaCy (for text processing)
    Flask / Streamlit (for UI)

### Dataset Information

The model was trained on a spam email dataset containing labeled examples of Spam and Not Spam emails, processed using NLP techniques.
